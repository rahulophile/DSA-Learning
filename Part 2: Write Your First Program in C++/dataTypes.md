**Data Types :** If we want to store any kind of data in computer then we need to create a variable and define it's type and that type is called Data Types in C++ and that variable name is called variable in C++.
---
*example :* 
```bash
int x = 20;
```
Here it means that x is a variable of *Integer* type. Integer genrally stores 4bytes of data for 32-bit system.

*example :*
```bash
char x = 'q'
```
Here it means that x is a variable of *Character* type. Character genrally stores 4bytes of data for 32-bit system, and it will always in single inverted comma ' ' not in " ".
